"""
This module implements a recursive Fibonacci number generator with caching
(memoization) using closures.

The implementation is based on lexical scoping principles (closures), where
the inner function maintains access to the cache defined in the outer function.

Example:
    fib = caching_fibonacci()
    print(fib(10))  # Outputs: 55

    Returns a Fibonacci function with internal caching.

    The returned function computes the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion,
    storing previously computed results in a cache to avoid redundant
    calculations.
